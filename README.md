# Landing Page
I created a landing page for a food delivery service using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript. The page features an eye-catching design that highlights the service's key offerings, with an intuitive layout that guides users to order food easily. I focused on making the page responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. JavaScript is used to enhance user interaction, such as adding hover effects and smooth scrolling. This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and user-centered design.
